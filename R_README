To perform the k means analysis on the data the file db_modified.csv has
to be created. This is created from the db.csv file created using the 
command:
	$python hdf5_to_csv.py PATH_TO/MillionSongSubset/data 

The output file db.csv is opened and saved as a proper csv file(db_modified.csv) 
for R has trouble handing multiple separator tokens.

Kmeans is performed on the resulting csv for 2 orders of partitioning using the 
musickmeans.r script.
Within R terminal:
	>source("musickmeans.r")
To output the partitions created to separate csv files, within the R terminal:
	>source("musickmeansWrite.r")

To see the cluster centers created in musickmeansWrite.r, the centers can be 
exported via the r script:
	>source("centers.r")

To see the accuracy of clustering within one level of clustering run the 
R script within the R terminal:
	>source("compared.r")
